# BusinessFinder

BusinessFinder is an MVP project that scrapes local business data, stores it in PostgreSQL, and enriches it by analyzing company websites for social media links such as Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook.

## Features

1. Scrapes business data from Google Places API based on localisation and keywords.
2. Stores data in JSON format and imports it into PostgreSQL.
3. Extracts and analyzes websites for social media presence (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook) and saves the links in the database.
4. Modular architecture: 3 independent scripts for flexibility and testing.
